As "When I was in your position, Izumi died during our confrontation with Reza, and as all the experience from all the different attempts vanished with her, I decided I had to become the person who would oversee the next one."

As "I didn't know just how complicated it would be."

As "Luckily, she left a lot behind to help me, and I executed her plan just as she would."

#As "And now, here we are."

c "So, what do we do now?"

As "Well, with the generators still intact, we will have no trouble diverting the comet and saving this world, but I also know that you feel very strongly about executing the mission you were sent here for."

As "Unfortunately, I'm starting to realize now that this won't be possible."

c "What are you talking about?"

As "As outlined in Izumi's plan, I deleted the coordinates that would lead back to humanity's portal when I repaired this one, replacing them with coordinates to travel back in time to the day of your arrival in this world."

As "Unfortunately, this means that our connection to humanity's portal is lost."

c "Are you saying we could've saved humanity if you just didn't remove those coordinates?"

As "I'm afraid so."

c "Then why did you do it?"

As "I didn't realize it would come to this. I just executed her plan as she would have. I can understand her reasoning for it, though."

As "It presents an extraordinary risk. Eliminating these coordinates also eliminates the possibility of Reza getting away through the portal and taking the generator we need with him."

c "Why not just tie them to my biometric data like the coordinates we need to travel back in time?"

As "That wouldn't be much help, because in scenarios where Reza escapes with the generator, he wouldn't hesitate to kill you to take what he needs to bypass the biometrics scan and use the portal anyway."

c "Then the only way to achieve what we want is to not delete those coordinates."

As "Can we really take that risk? You know that if we fail badly enough even once - if the portal gets destroyed, or if both the Administrator and you die - there won't be any more chances."

c "If you have seen what goes on from the Administrator's side during my stay here, I suppose you should be the one to decide that."

c "That still doesn't address the question of what we should do now, though."

As "If we want to make this happen, one of us will have to go back and do this all over again."

c "And what happens to the other?"

As "They could stay here and live their life however they wanted."

c "What about Adine?"

As "I wish I could stay with her. All she does for the orphans... I wish I could be part of that."

As "I wish I could be done with this already and settle down, but someone has to go back and ensure we can reach the outcome both of us want. No matter if it's you or me, one of us has to do it." 

As "Otherwise, all those we know back home, they... I don't think I need to tell you."

c "Why are you making me think of those who suffer?"

As "You'll never forget them, and if you don't do this, it will haunt you. I know."

c "What do you want me to do? Go back in time and do it all over again?"

As "It's what we've been trying to do all this time, you know. No compromise."

c "And of course you want me to do it so you can stay here, huh?"

As "I will do it myself if that's what it takes. I just hoped it wouldn't have to be me."

c "Don't we both?"

As "If we wanted to settle for an outcome where we just stop the comet and stay here, we could have done so a long time ago."

c "That doesn't mean that we're both not tired of this."

As "Maybe forgetting everything again by stepping through the portal would be a boon, then."

c "Don't try to make this more palatable for me. How many times have we done this now?"

As "..."

Ad think b "What will you do now?"

c "For the time being, I suppose I'll be stuck in this world."

Ad disappoint b "Just losing the connection to humanity's portal... How is that even possible?"

c "I don't know. Maybe we'll never be able to re-establish contact."

Ad normal b "No matter what happens, you'll always be welcome here."

Ad disappoint b "You put your life on the line to save us, and it cost your colleague his life."

c "Reza was never my colleague."

Ad think b "Then what was he, exactly?"

c "You know, maybe it's better if humanity never finds out what happened."

Ad disappoint b "Oh, well..."

Ad normal b "Either way, I'm glad you're here now. And I think Amely will appreciate it, too."

c "You think so?"

Ad "I'm sure of it! The people from the orphanage should be here any minute now."

c "I'm a bit nervous, to be honest."

Ad think b "Have you ever babysat before?"

c "Not a dragon, that's for sure."

Ad normal b "Don't worry, I'll be here with you the whole time. But you'll have to be very careful, alright?"

c "Of course."
