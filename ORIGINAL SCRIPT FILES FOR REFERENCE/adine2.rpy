Ad "We recognize images that are relevant to our lives, and that gives us an idea about ourselves and our current problems."

Ad think b "However, that is just the most grounded interpretation out there. People usually associate something more paranormal with fortune cards."

Ad "One of those explanations is that the cards are our way to communicate with a higher being, a paranormal entity that knows more than we do and can give us subtle nudges using the cards."
