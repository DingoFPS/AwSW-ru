n "My approach was to tinker with the fertilized egg cell's DNA in order to create a living organism whose immune system would be strong enough to combat cancer all on its own."

n "Once it hatched, I could make a few transplants, and a new way to fight cancer would be born."

Sy "This is the kind of job that is so top secret that I wouldn't be surprised if we were all killed after we hand over the data."

Iz "Good thing we're not expendable, huh?"

Fr "You think they're sending us into the middle of nowhere without seeing us as expendable?"

Hz "People, please. First of all, you were briefed about this, so you should already know what your duties will be."

Hz "I am sure all of you are well qualified to perform as expected, but let's get to what this project is really about."

Hz "Does anyone want to make a guess?"

Fr "Since I am here, it can only mean something with military applications."

Hz "Good guess. Ms. Thomas?"

Sy "Does it have anything to do with PTSD, per chance?"

Hz "Not quite. How about you, Ms. Otomo?"

Iz "I have no idea. Just get to the point, please."

Hz "Let me sum this up in one sentence: Intelligent, trainable bioweapons as low-cost alternative to mechanized weaponry in developing countries."

Fr "Interesting, very interesting."

Hz "Now, this conundrum we find ourselves in might actually work out in our favor. Since we are outside of any jurisdiction now, that means we can do whatever we want during this little project of ours." 

Hz "Just think of the opportunities."

Sy "You intend to utilize human DNA in this project, don't you?"

Fr "I thought they would do that anyway, and pay off whichever country we would find ourselves in."

Hz "Yes, but now we won't even have to do that anymore."

Iz "It will take me a while to repair all the damage and re-establish communications with the company. Until then we're kinda stuck here."

Hz "Who says we need to wait until then?"

Sy "I don't know. I don't think they'd like it if we just went ahead with the project before they even know what happened to us."

Iz "Sometimes, it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission."

Sy "That's how you end up in jail."

Hz "What else are we supposed to do while we are here? If worst comes to worst, we can just destroy the results."

Hz "Heck, if this works out, we are the only ones who have a portal into the past like this. It could be only the first of many incredible opportunities." 

Hz "Think about all the animals we could use - the raw materials and plants, even the atmosphere. I can already smell all the rare gases here that we could harvest."

Iz "I think that's just the ventilation system being wonky. I haven't had the time to adjust it yet."

Sy "You're only thinking about the company, but what about us?"

Fr "Already thinking about mutiny? I think that would be a bad idea."

Iz "I thought our salary already contained an eternal loyalty and silence bonus."

Fr "That's the thing with greed. People always crave more, regardless of how much they already have."

Hz "All this discussion is pointless. I'm the team lead, and I decide we do this."

Sy "As long as you take responsibility if there are any troubles..."

Hz "I know what the company wants, and I say this will make them more than just happy. In a few years, you will thank me for it. Trust me."

Iz "If you say so."

Sy "If we were going to make bioweapons, what animals would we have based them on if we didn't end up here?"

Hz "The great thing is that we don't have to choose. We already have technology that does all that work for us. We just need to provide the samples, and based on our criteria, we get a customized genome that fits our purpose as best as possible."

Iz "And you want to give them human intelligence?"

Hz "Why wouldn't we give them as much intelligence as we can?"

Iz "If they can think too advanced, too abstract, don't you think they might start to have independent thoughts? How are you going to control them?"

Hz "That's what Ms. Thomas and Mr. Bordelon are here for. With the right training, it shouldn't be an issue. Besides, you know that most human soldiers are obedient, right?"

Iz "I suppose so."

Sy "How do we know this is going to work with dinosaur DNA as well?"

Hz "We will find out soon enough."

Fr "Should we?"

Hz "That is not a question we ask at this company. You should know that by now."

Fr "Have you never seen {i}Jurassic Park{/i}?"

Iz "If you want to see {i}Jurassic Park{/i}, you only need to open that door."

Hz "You will soon find that all your concerns are unfounded, and I'll show you why."

Hz "But first, let me talk about abilities. Now that we have a whole new world of potential samples, we should be able to find even better alternatives to what we have been planning."

Fr "What abilities would those be?"

Hz "Flight, armor, fire, to name a few."

Iz "All at once? That sounds an awful lot like dragons."

Hz "Dragons are scary, aren't they? This could even be a psychological component. To be fair, getting all of those into the same species could be complicated."

Fr "You think you can do something nature couldn't?" 

Hz "That's why we're here."

Sy "What animal is the fire ability based on?"

Hz "The bombardier beetle. We're going to make the mechanism safer and easier to control, though."

Sy "Alright, so we're going to combine animal strengths with higher cognitive abilities, but how are you going to prevent others from stealing the genome? Backyard breeders could be a problem."

Hz "A very good question. There are a number of safeguards we are going to introduce to prevent any unauthorized copying of our product."

Hz "Firstly, there is the genome itself. Raising these creatures from infancy to a point where they become usable for their purpose will take some time." 

Hz "Since we are going to do this ourselves, we have a unique blend of hormones to make them reach this stage fairly quickly."

Hz "Making them grow up naturally is something that will take so much time and resources as to become unviable by anyone who would want to go that route. With us, they can be combat ready in months instead of years."

Hz "Secondly, all creatures will be equipped with a brain implant. Not only will this give them a variety of advantages, but it's another safeguard against copying as well. Without the chip, they will either become uncontrollable or die."

Hz "So, even if the genome is stolen, that won't be worth anything without the chip."

Sy "That's genius." 

Hz "I know."

Fr "Couldn't someone just hack or reverse-engineer the chip and manufacture it themselves?"

Hz "I doubt it. They're intended to be sold in low-technology areas. Even if they can reverse-engineer the chip, they don't have the facilities to mass-manufacture them. Otherwise they'd just be using combat robots like everyone else."

Fr "You want to modify their behavior with technology? Being dependent on a chip sounds dangerous. What if it fails?"

Hz "Don't worry about that."

Hz "Lastly, there is the training. Training any living being - no matter if human or not - takes time and money." 

Hz "Not only do we have an automated training program, but we can also use the implant to accelerate this process."

Sy "What about direct transference of knowledge into the creatures' brains via the implant?"

Hz "That technology is still in its infancy. If we want to get this product out and into the market as soon as possible, we'll need a solution that works right now." 

Sy "Fair enough."

Hz "It will give the user full control as well. The creatures will be able to learn from experience, but undesirable memories can be wiped easily."

Fr "Sounds like you have it all figured out already."

Hz "The company has been working on this project for a long time, and now it's up to us to make it reach its natural conclusion."

Iz "And what would that be?"

Hz "Our product is the creature, the chip and the training. All in one complete package. Take away just one of these three components and the product won't work as intended." 

Hz "We deliver them ready to be used in combat from the moment they arrive at the customer's doorstep."

Iz "I still think we should wait before you rush into using animals that we hardly know anything about."

Hz "Your opinion has been noted, Ms. Otomo, but it won't carry much weight."

#Iz "Yeah, just go ahead and try to find another engineer to calibrate all your machinery around here."
