c "Didn't the entry specify that it's typically used by females?"

Ry "Now that you mention it, I did get that impression, but I found the sentiment a bit puzzling. Why would a product like this only be used by one gender?"

c "Well, I guess social norms dictated that certain traits are only desirable in one gender, thus highlighting them like this would increase the attractiveness."

Ry "Oh, I think I get it now. It's all based on sexual dimorphism. The biological differences between the sexes are much greater in your species than it is in ours, so I suppose the traits you are looking for can be different, too."

Ry "Generally speaking, sexual dimorphism is much greater in mammals than it is in reptiles." 

Ry "While it can vary wildly by species, external indicators are pretty much always present. Like mammaries, for example - an always-present and often obvious reminder."

Ry "You wouldn't believe how much joy I felt during that moment. Emera, of course, took all the limelight she could. First there was a big speech in front of a huge crowd, then a procession after she had officially welcomed Reza."

Ry "When it was time for you to arrive and it was decided that it wouldn't be a public event this time due to security concerns, I knew that Emera wasn't going to be there if she wasn't able to make it all about herself."

Ry shy "I begged her to let me do it, just to be able to get this close to a human at least once. To talk with them and see what they were like - to experience them."

Ry "She told me that if I did a few favors for her, I could be the one to greet you." 

Ry sad "I knew that she wasn't going to be there anyway, but if I didn't do what she wanted, she would just send some other lackey instead."

Ry "So I did everything she asked for."

Ry "It might not have seemed like much to you, but with just us two and no one else being there, it was something very special for me."

Ry "It was not just some public spectacle like the summer festival or Reza's arrival, but for the first time in so long, I felt like that moment was about you and me - and no one else."

Ry "For someone in my position, it just made me very happy to have such an extraordinary thing happen to me."

Ry "Of course I was very curious to see how much our myths would line up with reality, and I was even more overjoyed when you visited me in the library."

Ry "When you accepted my invitation and came into my home, I was just glad to have you there."

Ry "It seemed like you wanted to be there and weren't just someone out to use me in some way. I began to feel hope."

Ry "What will you do once you get back to your own world again?"

c "I'm not sure. I don't even know what will happen to me when I return."

c "These last few days, a lot of things have happened that have changed my perspective on what I'm doing here, Reza and those who sent me."

Ry "Is that a bad thing?"

c "I don't know yet. At the very least, though, I can say that I've done what I believed was right."

Ry "You should be careful with rhetoric like that."

c "What do you mean?"

Ry "That kind of talk makes it very easy to justify any means when it serves the right cause, whatever that may be. The more important thing is: Have you done anything that you might regret?"

Ry "No matter what you think, keep in mind that you may be held accountable for your actions by others or even yourself."

Ry "Don't just do something because you think it's for the right reasons. Do it when you are aware of the possible consequences as well."

c "You're right. I have no way of knowing what my actions here will amount to once I return."

Ry "Do you really wish to go back to your own world?"

#c "Even if I had a say in the matter, I don't think it would be a good idea to go against them now." 

c "If I didn't, it would only serve to strain the relationship we've been trying to build with your people here, which is something that could be elementary for our survival."

c "Besides, I didn't do it for those who reign over the city back home, or those who might've wanted to betray me."

c "Let's not forget that even under the worst regimes there are just normal people trying to survive, too."

c "If I have the power to make a difference for them, would it be right for me to just leave them be in order to seek my own happiness? That's exactly the kind of thing you were talking about, right?"

Ry "In the end, we all have to make our own decisions."

c "If I leave them behind, then I leave them to people like Reza and those who sent me here."

Ry "What would you want to do? Overthrow them?"

c "I don't even have the complete picture myself right now. How could I even consider what to do, given what I know?"

c "What I do know, though, is that if I don't do what they expect of me, there will be consequences."

Ry "Maybe you'll just have to wait and see."

c "That's not an option right now. Reza is still out there, armed and dangerous."

Ry shy "Don't you think that's a matter better left to our police force? It could be very dangerous for you to interfere."

c "It's far too late to reconsider. I've already been tangled up in this too much. Besides, I can't stop now." 

c "Don't forget how many he has killed already. He won't hesitate to do so again in order to reach his goal."

c "In the end, it’s my duty to stop him. If I don’t, how would your people look at humanity?"

c "How could I face you again, knowing that my negligence could cause suffering and loss for others here if I just stopped now?"

Ry normal "I wish I could be as brave as you."

c "Don't think bravery has anything to do with it. He must be stopped, one way or another."

Ry "I know. Just be careful, alright?"

c "I'll try."

Ry "We've been here for a while now. How about I walk you back to your apartment?"

c "What about the festival?"

Ry "Well, if you still want to go, we could watch the big fireworks show together in a few days."

c "That's an idea."

Ry smile "Alright, let's do that."
