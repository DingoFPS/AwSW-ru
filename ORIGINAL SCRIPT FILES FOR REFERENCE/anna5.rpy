As "What are you planning to do now?"

c "I don't know, Izumi. What do you think we should do? We have to stop the comet, after all."

Iz "So you remember my name. What else do you remember?"

c "I know we can stop the comet, but I also want to help humanity. I'd be just like Reza if I didn't try, you know. Just helping one world and disregarding the suffering of the other."

Iz "That's why I was asking for your plan."

c "Sending generators now would be out of the question, since we'll need all we can gather in order to stop the comet."

Iz "That is correct."

c "Unfortunately, I also know that by the time we've stopped the comet, humanity will have given up on the portal and disconnected its power source, so we won't be able to help them afterwards."

Iz "You remember well."

c "The solution to this would be rather simple: We'd just need to let them know to wait a while longer while the dragons recover from expending all their power sources to stop the comet."

c "We could just send them a letter."

Iz "I'm afraid that won't be possible."

c "And why is that?"

Iz "After what happened during some of our other attempts, I decided to delete the coordinates to humanity's portal when I repaired this one a few days ago."

c "But the portal has ways to locate other functional portals, right? We could re-establish the connection."

Iz "Unfortunately, looking for other portals through time and space would be a significant energy expenditure that we can't afford right now. Not if we want to stop the comet."

c "I... reject this outcome. If there is no way to send them help, I will go back to the day of my arrival and try again. That's why you put those coordinates in, after all."

Iz "No, that's not your call to make. These coordinates were only to be used in emergencies, or if we failed."

c "As far as I am concerned, we did fail."

Iz "Look at this world and what they have achieved under my guidance. You want to jeopardize this for a chance – just a chance - to save your city as well?"

c "It's what I came here for. Reza too, but he's dead now, so I'm the only one they have left to fight for their survival."

c "I can't just leave them now. As nice as it would be, a life here would be a life built on the suffering of others. I wouldn't be able to live with myself knowing that I could've helped them but didn't because I took the easy way out."

c "As far as I am concerned, this isn't over yet."

#Iz "Who do you really want to save, those who sent Reza? Those who supported him?"

Iz "You want to save those who sent Reza, and his supporters?"

Iz "Is this really about humanity, or about Anna?"

Iz "She sacrificed herself for you, not for you to undo it all again."

Iz "It is her sacrifice that makes it possible to save this world now. Is that not enough for you?"

c "No, I'm going."

Iz "If that is your final decision, you leave me no other choice."
