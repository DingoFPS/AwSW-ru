n "A few years ago, I worked in the public sector. I mean, I still do, but my position was a different one. I didn't work under a minister back then."

n "I was part of a committee tasked with providing independent and factually backed opinions on community topics. It was supposed to help not only politicians, but also the general populace."

n "Free from outside interference, we did our own fact-checking based on research and publicly reported our findings. Our individual members didn't always agree, but we made sure the end results were based on verifiable facts."

n "In this way, we offered a variety of comprehensive opinions on difficult topics. We found the truth, and allowed people and politicians to make up their minds from there. Our work was a key influence in the community, and because the conclusions of each individual member were often very different, it could never be said that we were biased."

n "It was during one such assignment that I met a certain person named Amelia."

n "My task was to determine the viability of several projects, each competing for a research grant from our council."

n "Amelia was a member of one of the scientific teams vying for a grant. She was an inventor, and her group was looking for ways to streamline hospital processes and tests by utilizing new technology."

n "The first time I saw her was when our committee watched her group's pitch. One of the things we had to do was determine whether their claims and goals were realistic."

n "In her case, they were."

n "Ultimately, they didn't get the grant, but when she recognized me in a restaurant a while later, we started talking."

n "She was very smart, and I admired her spirit. She just wanted to help people with her talents - and in this way, she reminded me a lot of myself."

n "We kept seeing one another, and we grew close. Before long, we were dating. It felt so right..."

n "I thought our relationship was about to become very serious, but then she informed me that her research group had applied for another grant."

n "Of course, that complicated things. My committee was once again tasked with judging the viability of the different projects, and while I intended to stay impartial on the matter, she would probably be seen as an influence due to our relationship."

n "With these concerns in mind, we decided to not meet again until the grant winner was determined. We hadn't expected her group to get it, but in the end, they did."

n "We didn't want to end our relationship over something like that, but if word got out that we were together during the decision-making period, it would've put both our jobs in jeopardy."

n "In the end, we decided to wait and made a commitment. Six months after the grant was given to her team, we would return to one another and make our relationship public. That much time would have ensured that it wouldn't be an issue. We even made plans to move in together when that time came."

n "But we never got that far. I only know the rest of what happened from various reports, but apparently, Amelia got sick. Nothing serious, mind you. She continued working from home as best as she could. The project was already behind schedule, and she didn't want to endanger it."

n "People were critical and very curious about what the project would amount to, and she didn't want to be responsible for its failure if she took some days off to recuperate."

n "One late evening, she went out to pick up her medication - in addition to something to help her stay awake. But she was sick and overworked. The combination of the prescription's side effects and the supplements caused her to collapse. No one was around to see her fall."

Ry "We had plans to move in together. We even talked about having our own, small family."

Ry "Some things are just not meant to be, it seems."

Ry sad "If I had to identify the moment life started going downhill, losing Amelia would be it."

Ry "My heart was ripped out in that moment, and now only emptiness remains. It's like a wound that never closes."

Ry shy "Maybe you saw those pictures in my apartment." 

Ry "Even my home is a reminder of her. We were going to move in to that apartment together."

Ry "And this tie I'm wearing? I got it from her as well."

Ry "When she gave it to me, she said that it was red like her scales. As long as I wore it, she would be with me, in a way."

Ry sad "For so long, I've been holding on to her with all my might. I wish I could stop, because I know it's killing me, but I've been doing it for so long that I don't think I can."

Ry shy "Yet in some way, holding on to Amelia has helped me. When I look back on all the happy memories we made, Emera's bullying hurts a little less, if only because those memories hurt so much more."

Ry sad "And I would love my job if it wasn't for Emera."

Ry "It's a constant struggle - a battle I have to fight every day. Each of her words slices through me, creating new wounds on top of others that never closed."

Ry shy "Some days, I just don't want to do it anymore. I don't know how much longer I can."

Ry "Since I work with Emera, I know all the details surrounding you and Reza. Not many do."

Ry look "Many rumors are going around town."

Ry shy "All this time, you've been working with our police?"

c "Yeah."

Ry "And now you're hunting the person who was supposed to be your partner. That must be really hard for you."

c "I came here because I wanted to do the right thing. Nothing about that has changed."

Ry look "What kind of person is Reza, anyway?"

c "The kind that stops at nothing to achieve what he believes in."

Ry "I can see that. We've already witnessed just how far he will go."

Ry "What do you think about him?"

c "Honestly, I'm not sure. Back home, this relentless quality of his was admired, but I certainly don't condone his actions. Given what I know about him, I think he must have a reason, as weird and twisted as it may be."

Ry shy "And what about you?"

c "I have my own principles."

Ry "I see."

Ry "How is your hunt for Reza going, anyway?"

c "Not too great. We don't have any strong leads or any idea of his whereabouts. In the end, we're just following his trail of murder and destruction."

Ry "People are getting afraid. The rumors are starting to take effect."

c "I thought Emera was going to give a press conference to warn the public."

Ry "That didn't happen. She feared the potential backlash if people knew about Reza while you were still here, so - for the time being - he has been declared as a missing person."

Ry "The public has been informed that if someone sees him, they are to call the police immediately. They were told he may be suffering from an affliction that makes him behave erratically."

Ry "But some people are putting two and two together. No one has seen Reza for a while, even before he was officially declared missing." 

Ry "It's easy to line up the timelines and see that the murders started happening shortly after he vanished." 

Ry "What we know about the break-ins and thefts is also damning. The objects stolen all point toward Reza. I'm not sure how much longer they can keep this a secret."

c "How do you think the public will react, considering that I am still staying here?"

Ry "I don't know. We can't really predict the public opinion, but you can bet there will be critical voices."

c "I'm not sure how I could convince everyone that I'm not involved with Reza's plans."

Ry normal "Well, you do have the council's support. If Emera voiced that you were on our side, it wouldn't be so bad if the public found out."

c "Yeah, but she also made it clear that she believes most people won't have the same opinion. She won't support me publically if their vote is against me."

Ry look "That is true. Emera plays the political game a lot. She aligns with the popular opinion so people will like her."

c "Does the public know about the portal's current state?"

Ry normal "No. If it can be fixed, it wouldn't be worth mentioning - and if they can't fix it, they aren't going to announce it before they know how to deal with the current situation."

Ry look "Compared to Reza, it's not really a problem."

c "It might become one pretty soon. If word gets out and I'm suddenly his accomplice, what would happen to me?"

c "How would you even deal with Reza if you caught him?"

Ry normal "I'm not sure. I suppose we would have to work something out between our legal system and whatever humanity has to say on the matter."

c "And if the portal is done for? What then?"

Ry "Then humanity would be out of the picture for any legal proceedings."

Ry "Reza would likely be held until contact has been re-established or just serve his sentence here."

c "I see. How do your jails work, anyway?"

Ry "Well, if a crime has been committed and proven without a doubt, a jail sentence can be the consequence."

Ry "Our delinquents live in an area separate from the rest of society, monitored at all hours of the day." 

Ry "They receive the help they need, and efforts are taken to make them realize their wrongdoings and integrate them back into our community."

Ry "Life isn't that much different there than it is here. The spaces are more cramped, for sure, but mostly it is just a very controlled environment."

c "That's not much of a punishment."

Ry "It is a consequence, not necessarily a punishment. Our society at large benefits more from people who are rehabilitated, and if mental issues are the cause, those can at least be found and addressed."

c "That sounds like how it used to be back home. These days, in our city, you get three strikes."

Ry "What does that mean?"

c "Three infractions of our rules and you get thrown out of the city. If someone is a drain on our limited resources, we won't support them."

Ry "While I can understand why you needed to incorporate such a policy, the finality of it makes me a bit uneasy."

c "It has worked so far. And it's not as if the outside is completely unkind."

c "Someone expelled from the city might find a different community, or join one of the mobile groups. The situation inside our city-state is still much better than the outside, though. They're very strict with those allowed to live there."

c "It is a privilege. Anyone or anything that threatens the inside society or the lives of its people is removed very quickly."

Ry "How would a murderer like Reza be dealt with? An eye for an eye?"

c "No, we don't do that, but murder is a crime so heinous that immediate expellation is the consequence - regardless of prior infractions."

Ry "I see. What do the citizens think about this system?"

c "Some agree with the methods, some don't - but as long as it works, people won't complain. Weeding out undesirable elements is what keeps their standard of living intact."

Ry "I guess that means politics don't play a big role where you come from."

c "No. They won't change a working system."

Ry look "It varies here, but I'm so tired of Emera and her games. As I work with her, I can see exactly how she plays the public." 

Ry "I know every council member has their own approach, but everything she does is so... tailored towards the public's expectations. For her it's just a popularity contest."

c "You know what? That gives me an idea."

Ry normal "Really? What is it?"

c "The human visit and all of the associated consequences are her responsibility, right?"

Ry "Yes."

c "For her, this situation with Reza must be utterly horrifying. She keeps talking about preventing public backlash, but she's really just trying to protect herself."

Ry "That sounds accurate."

c "Maybe we can use that to our advantage."

Ry "How?"

c "She can't send me back to my world right now. That makes me the only one here with knowledge of Reza, and humans in general."

Ry "That's true."

c "If I speak from this point of authority, we should have a much easier time convincing her of anything we want."

Ry "You couldn't convince her to let you stay in our world, though."

c "Yes, but I was trying to use reason and plead with her. I didn't take into account her fear of public backlash." 

c "I think we can manipulate this fear of hers and use it to our advantage. If there were consequences to fear from Reza, me, or the rest of humanity - and those consequences would make her look bad to the public - that would be reason for her to reconsider any action, right?"

Ry "I suppose so, but what situation could this apply to?"

c "She nearly sent me back through the portal. If she tries anything again, at least we have something we can use against her."

Ry "I think I see where you're coming from."

Ry "Reza is still a mystery to me, though. All things considered, wouldn't it be beneficial for him to just stay here? No offense, but even our prisons offer a better standard of living than your city."

Ry "As such, couldn't that be a reason for him to have vandalized the portal?"

c "I don't think so. You're right, your world is in much better shape than ours, but even if Reza could stay here, he wouldn't. He came here for the same reason I did - to help our people." 

c "He has a very pronounced sense of duty to humanity, and I believed in him when he stepped through the portal. He proclaimed that he would do everything he could." 

c "When I met him again in this world, I had the impression that he wanted to get our mission over with as soon as possible so he could return to our world with aid."

Ry "That's going to be difficult with the portal out of order."

c "The person who did it probably didn't realize it wasn't a very good idea. This might make Reza even more desperate. Who knows what he will do next?"

c "And if anything happens, I can't leave either."

Ry "If the portal is gone for good, I suppose you'd have to stay here. What do you think about that?"
