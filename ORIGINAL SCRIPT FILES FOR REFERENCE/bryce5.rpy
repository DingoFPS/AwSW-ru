Iz "If I had come to you during the first night and tried to explain to you that I am a time traveller who had to kill in order to prevent a suffering that is magnitudes greater - genocide, slavery - would you have believed me?"

Iz "If he didn't kill anyone, there would have been no investigation, and you wouldn't have known how dangerous he is when he shows his true colors."

Iz "You just saw that even in this scenario he wouldn't shy away from shooting others to get what he wants."

Iz "Besides, I didn't want to risk jeopardizing our experience by changing things. It could erase all the progress we have made and the things we learned over the many times we've done this now. "

Iz "If I didn't shove you out of the way in the cellar when the light fixture came down, you would've died then and there. That's what happened the first few times."

Iz "You could not have followed the same path and arrived here if I didn't kill them. The fact that you remembered that it was originally Reza who did it only proves just how important this is." 

Iz "Only if the events stay the same long enough will you be able to learn from them and remember, despite the effects the repeated teleportations have on your memory."

Iz "This only tells me that I made the right call."

c "If Reza had nothing to do with it, then what was he doing when he was trying to take the generator?"

Iz "I slipped him a note he thought came from you. It said to meet here and take the generator before you'd leave together. He played his part well enough so you couldn't tell the difference."

c "So, he really did think that I planned all of this, that I lured him here to have him arrested by Bryce and Maverick."
