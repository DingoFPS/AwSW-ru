c "I can show you."

Ad think b "Okay, so we need smooth, flat stones."

c "Hold the stone like this, extend your arm, and curl it like this. Then, you have to throw in such a way that it stays relatively stable in the air, but spins as fast as you can make it."

m "I threw the stone, once again showing her how it subsequently bounced a few times over the water's surface before it sunk into the sea."

Ad disappoint b "I'm not sure if I can do that."

c "We'll see. Maybe we can figure something out."

c "Let's look for a stone first."

Ad normal b "Okay."

c "Okay, now for the technique..."

m "She was holding the stone in the claws at the edge of her wing. I tried to guide her by pulling her wing back like I would an arm, but it became clear to me that it lacked a lot of maneuverability an arm would have."

c "For the throw, you'll want to move your wing forward as fast as you can, and at the very end of the extension, let go of the stone."

Ad "I'll try."

c "I'm not so sure about that. I bet it's a lot easier with your claws. Fish can be pretty slippery."

Ad giggle b "I guess you have a point."

Ad normal b "Well, there's still the other method."

c "I see."

Ad normal b "Though, I suppose angling is also going to be hard for you without a forked tail like we have."

c "Actually, we have fishing rods for that where I come from."

Ad think b "What's that?"

c "The principle is very similar. Basically, it's a long stick that we hold over the water. A line connected to it has a bait and hook at the end to catch the fish. When the fish bites the hook, we can reel in the line to get the fish to us."

Ad "So you are using a tool to do a very similar thing."
