From what I knew, other portals had been created in the past and were under consideration for mass application. As for this one in particular, though, we did not know who had built it, nor when - or why we found it in the wilderness where we did. What was more exciting to us was the fact that it was... functional."

nvl clear

n "After our first tests, we found there was someone else on the other side who was in possession of a similar portal, and our attempts at communication through letters were successful. But in the end, the machine’s extraordinary demand for power meant we needed to act quickly as we wouldn’t be able to keep the portal open much longer. "
n "When we made this known to the other side, we received a very unexpected reply: A letter of invitation. After some deliberation, it was decided to accept their hospitality and send a person to the other side."
n "There was an individual who took the job almost immediately."

n "I wasn't sure what to think about the whole thing, but he had to have known what he was doing. He certainly was brave."
n "Either that, or just very, very foolish."
n "While I wasn't sure which, his courage was applauded by others. After all, he couldn't possibly have known who or what would await him at the other end of the portal, and if he did meet someone there, who knew what kinds of intentions they might have?"
n "Not that any speculation on our part would've made a difference."

n "Then we waited..."
n "The crowd that was applauding him slowly dispersed when the enthusiasm died down, as there was nothing for us to do but wait and speculate."
n "Approximately 8 hours later, we received our first message from him."
n "While we had assumed the portal led to another in a different country, or maybe on a different continent, the reality turned out to be much more... foreign."
n "The situation he described to us was so outlandish that we initially took it as a joke."
n "A very bad joke, maybe, with even worse timing and no punchline at all."
nvl clear
n "It soon became clear to us, though, that we may just have made one of the most important discoveries since the dawn of mankind."
n "Finding the portal had been remarkable in itself, but this took it to a completely different level."

n "From what he described about the place - or, more accurately, its inhabitants - we surmised it could not be part of Earth at all."
n "We called them {i}dragons{/i}, because according to Reza, that's what they were, or at least what they resembled most."
n "Even though we found it hard to believe, it had been these dragons who sent us all the letters. And what Reza found on the other side of the portal was a whole civilization of them. They could talk, write books, had buildings and electricity. In many ways, their society was actually very similar to our own."
nvl clear
n "So, who were they? And where was this place? Could they be aliens?"
n "Our speculations led us to conclude otherwise. After all, we knew about the existence of thousands of planets, millions of light-years away that may have been theoretically habitable, yet even then we had never found conclusive proof in regards to actual alien life-forms."

n "Some people brought up quantum mechanics and parallel universes, but in the end all of this was just conjecture and an ultimately fruitless endeavor, since we neither had the means nor the resources to explore these possibilities in greater detail."
nvl clear
n "I think there's just one more thing worth mentioning before I move on:"
n "The previous isolation had been mutual."
n "They hadn't known about any other intelligent life-form beyond their own, their portal had only recently been discovered and was a technology previously unknown to them, and just as we had myths about dragons, they had myths about us."

n "That was what we knew about them so far, and as interesting as learning those things and debating their cultural significance was, we didn't really know what we should make of it all."
n "Reza apparently was sure of what he was doing, though, as he eventually let us know that they had agreed on a trade."
nvl clear
n "We were to give them a few of our PDA devices, which contained vast amounts of knowledge, dwarfing even that of encyclopedias. In return, they would supply us with generators."
n "Overall, they didn't seem as technologically advanced as we had been, but they did surpass us in that one aspect. Their means of generating energy seemed... sustainable."
n "Not only that, but evidently also quite efficient. We certainly would be able to put technology like that to good use, and trading mere past knowledge of the human race for something more...  tangible... was a good call on his part."

n "My prior experience in both biology and sociology made me a good fit to deliver our PDA devices for the trade. And while in the dragons' world, waiting for the prototypes of our generators to be manufactured by them, I would act as an ambassador on humanity's behalf."
n "What a way to make a first impression by a display of mutual goodwill. Everyone benefits and everyone goes home happy."
n "All is well."
n "At least, that was the plan."
nvl clear
n "Despite the images that living, talking dragons might conjure up in some people's minds, I didn't even think of bringing a weapon myself, considering that they were reportedly friendly and peaceful enough."
n "There was no need for me to fear potential ill intentions like Reza did when he had stepped into unknown territory, and acting as humanity's ambassador, I had to do my best to uphold a high standard in fostering this diplomatic relationship."
n "When the time came for me to step through the portal, all my mental preparedness vanished. My anxiousness was fueled by all the questions lurking in my head, just as the machine started to do its work."
nvl clear

n "Would it hurt?"
n "Who would I meet on the other side?"
n "What if they really weren't so friendly and just made Reza write those letters, with the pretense of appearing friendly, only to lure us into the den of man-eating monsters and certain doom, with us ending up as nothing more than a tasty afternoon snack?"
