n "Then, one day, we heard from someone that there was a system of caves nearby. Caves! That was something completely new to us. Of course we went there as soon as we could."

n "We were all very excited. It wasn't a big cave system - not big enough to get lost in - but we still had so much fun that day."

n "Maybe that was my mistake. When I was in one of the remote corners, the ground suddenly gave way and I fell about 5 metres into the cave below."

n "Luckily, I didn't get any serious injuries from the fall, but as I looked for another exit, an ominous realization set in: This cave had no entry or exit except the one I came in."
